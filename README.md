# Webdevpack, a website offering tools that help web devs and make their lives easier.

The first tool is a Color Picker, that lets a user pick a color and displays the Hex value.

The second tool is a Pixel Locator, which identifies any pixel's x,y coordinates from an image.



TODO: Add other tools (e.g. From Bootstrap 4: Loading spinner generator, Progress bar generator, etc.)

Additional Note: check https://github.com/yangcha/iview for Pixel Locator inspiration.
